# Network_Error_Report_Gen

Made 6/14/2022

For demo at LifeTrends

I made this easy Windows script to compile network information from systems that have errors.
This will generate a .log file titles "LifeTrends_NWERR" followed by date and time info.

Scripting is very important to troubleshooting.
I was taught to, "Do it once and then make a script to do it for you."

While simple, I hope this showcases my willingness to bring new ideas and find new solutions.
